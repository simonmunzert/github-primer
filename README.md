# A tiny appetizer for using Git/GitHub in social science research

## What is Git?

- Git is a revision control system
- allows you to track changes to any text-based files (e.g., R code, Stata code, LaTeX documents, raw text files, CSV files, etc.)
- being a distributed system, it encourages collaboration on software projects
- typically used for software development and other version control tasks
- created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 (yes, THE Linus Torvalds!)
- typically used from the command line

## What is GitHub?

- web service "on top of Git" that allows you to host Git repositories
- offers functionality of Git as well as other features
- as of April 2016, more than 14 million users and more than 35 million repositories --> largest host of source code in the world
- browser functionality with social-networking-like features
- desktop client for all platforms, which facilitates using Git a lot
- if you host your repositories publicly, it's free
- if you want to host (parts of) them privately, you have to pay for it (unless you're a student); see https://github.com/pricing
- you can simply use the service as an online repository for your code
- you can follow other code projects ("fork" them), e.g., packages, to monitor but also suggest changes
- you can file issues to other projects ("Function x of your package does not work for me, is there a bug?", "I have a suggestion of how to improve your package")


## Why should I use Git/GitHub for my research?

- easy way to publish code/appendices/additional results, independent of a publisher
- present work in progress before article is published
- make your research reproducible; this ideally means that you publish the entire project, including original data and all the code (both cleaning and analysis code)
- do better version control, no longer `analysis_survey_final_revised.R` or keep old files an a designated folder
- retain full control over the availability of your data
- host your own website
- indirectly by using latest versions of statistical software---much of the interesting work in the R community is published on GitHub even before packages get finally published on CRAN
